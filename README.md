## How to play

Blunderchess follows the rules of normal chess, with one twist: at certain points, you get to play for your opponent and try to make them blunder.

#### Turn Order

Player 1 is trying to win as White, and Player 2 is trying to win as Black. The turn order is as follows:

1. Player 1 plays for White
1. Player 2 plays for Black
1. Player 1 plays for White
1. Player 2 plays for Black
1. **Player 2 plays for White (attempting to make White blunder)**
1. **Player 1 plays for Black (attempting to make Black blunder)**
1. Player 1 plays for White
1. Player 2 plays for Black
1. Player 1 plays for White
1. Player 2 plays for Black
1. Player 1 plays for White
1. **Player 1 plays for Black (attempting to make Black blunder)**
1. **Player 2 plays for White (attempting to make White blunder)**
1. Player 2 plays for Black

This cycle continues throughout the game, forcing players to balance good moves with sabotage when given control of their opponentâ€™s pieces.
